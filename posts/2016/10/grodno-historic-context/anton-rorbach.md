Anton Rohrbach
Antalis Rohrbachas
(1825 - 1889)

> Hungarian pharmacist and early amateur photographer based in Szeged (Seged) in Hungary. In 1848 he completed his pharmacy studies at the Hungarian Royal University in Pest.

> Rohrbach photographed the construction of the railway bridge across the Tisza at Seged (1857-1859) which was supervised by the French engineer Ernest Cézanne. The first photographs of the bridge across the Tisza taken by Rohrbach showed photographer’s professionalism and ability to high quality panoramas of engineering structures.

> In 1861 Rohrbach was commissioned by Ernest Cézanne to document the construction of bridges of the St. Petersburg-Warsaw railway in then Russian Empire. During his stay here he made a series of panoramic photographs of bridges across the Daugava at Daugavpils, the Nemunas (Neman) at Kaunas and Grodno and of other bridges across the smaller rivers on this railway. He also took pictures of Kaunas (Lithuania), Grodno (Byelorussia), Rezekne and Daugavpils (Latvia), which are considered to be the earliest photographs of these places. The last known photographs by Rohrbach were taken in around 1871 in Szeged.

> Photographs of the Tisza bridge are held in the Austrian National Library, Photothèque des L'École des Ponts ParisTech. Albums of the St. Petersburg-Warsaw railway photographs are held in the National Library of Spain and private collections.
