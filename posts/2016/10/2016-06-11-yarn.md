Facts:

- `yarn` is an alternative to npm client, i.e. `npm` CLI
- differences from `npm` client
  - `yarn` produces deterministic installs
  - `yarn` adds package checksums
  - `yarn` controls which lifecycle methods are run
  - `yarn` **doesn't** authenticate, so no private scoped packages for now
